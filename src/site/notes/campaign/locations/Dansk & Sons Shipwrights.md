## Notes
We paid 17K gold upfront to have them repair our ship. we agreed that if we brought them the materials to have a steampowered saw built and that [[campaign/players/Dags\|Dags]] built them for them that they would cover the second half of our payment. 
[[campaign/players/Sin\|Sin]] ensured we got that in writing, and the brothers wanted us to make the steam powered sawmills in covered areas so that no others would know how they're doing what they're doing.
