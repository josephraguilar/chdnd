## Notes
First heard of her from the Guildmaster in [[campaign/locations/GoodWeather Bay\|GoodWeather Bay]]. Caravans went missing so we were sent to find out why, turns out undead dragons were attacking caravans. 

We decided to leave her be, and she pointed us to where we could find adamantium. 

After [[campaign/players/Sim\|Sim]] died the party asked her to resurret Sim, but [[campaign/players/Sin\|Sin]] came back somehow instead
