## Log
We got to Minkas and convince her to come with us on our trip after some convincing. 
[[campaign/players/Ulric Moonshadow\|Ulric Moonshadow]] opened the box with his mage hand and it sprayed white paint everywhere. 

There was about 12 well made white glazed jar. They're not transparent. 
[[campaign/players/Dags\|Dags]] identifies what's in the jars.  its highly concentrated snake venom. 

We water it down and get 6 bottles of snake venom

we head to [[campaign/locations/Fishburg\|Fishburg]] and travel through the night

we deliver the goods to the [[campaign/npcs/Shem McGillicuddy\|Shem McGillicuddy]], ulric sneaks and finds out that they are delivering the venom to an active thieves guild. we then go to the street where dags paid minka to punch flynn. they then got into a fight as the party went into the inn. 
Sin called tech support to try and get her soul back into hell. sim's body is locked in her locker. tech support said theyd get back to her and gave her a ticket number 666. she spoke with [[campaign/npcs/Alochar\|Alochar]]. Manon heard her and agreed not to tell anyone but needs it in writing.

Faliq cheers's everyone and drugs [[campaign/npcs/Minka\|Minka]]. everyone departs to [[campaign/locations/GoodWeather Bay\|GoodWeather Bay]]. we are bad at flying the magic carpets and bump into people on the way. Dags begins working on the machinery, and Ulrich and sin help him. 

Faliq finds her ancient dwarven book and gets mentally teleported to a smithy with a dwarven man making something. he tries to help her towards the smith. She realizes she's in the presence of a secondary deity [[campaign/npcs/Hemmig\|Hemmig]]. she hands the bow to the secondary god. she begins to forge something.  the sword she made is now in the book, but it doesnt have a name or anything about it. 

in about 3 days we built the saw mill. and begin to fix the [[campaign/items/Codfather\|Codfather]]. 

Ulrich, manon, and and sin went to go steal the [[campaign/items/Sword of General Persinious\|Sword of General Persinious]]. After setting off an alarm, they got the sword, summoned a greater demon, and crawled out through a hatch in the roof. 

Dags enlists the help of seamstresses and tries to deck out the codfather. he spends two weeks and lots of gold. He has them create a new balloon, it is "slaughter red". 

faliq and minka got matching T-shirts and faliq gets her clothes. 

The ship is rebuilt and is now named. Dags named it the [[campaign/items/Bloodwind Marauder\|Bloodwind Marauder]].

we christen the boat but the glass doesn't break. cruising speed 22 knotts in the water.

we take on the youngest dansk son to be a deckhand. [[campaign/npcs/Timeteo\|Timeteo]] .
