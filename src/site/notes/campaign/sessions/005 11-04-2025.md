## AI Summary
The party traveled to **Minka’s**, where they persuaded her to join their journey after some convincing. During this, **Ulric Moonshadow** used _Mage Hand_ to open a mysterious box, which burst and sprayed white paint everywhere. Inside were twelve white-glazed, opaque jars. **Dags** examined their contents and identified them as highly concentrated snake venom. The group diluted the venom, producing six usable bottles.

They journeyed overnight to **Fishburg**, where they delivered the shipment to **Shem McGillicuddy**. Ulric covertly discovered the venom was destined for an active thieves’ guild. Nearby, **Dags** and **Minka** had a street altercation with **Flynn**, as arranged earlier. Later, **Sin** called “tech support” to inquire about reclaiming her soul from Hell; her call with **Alochar** ended with a support ticket number “666.” **Manon** overheard the conversation, agreed to keep quiet, but demanded written assurance.

At an inn celebration, **Faliq** toasted the group—then secretly drugged Minka. The party departed for **GoodWeather Bay**, flying on magic carpets with clumsy results. While **Dags** worked on the ship’s machinery, **Ulric** and **Sin** assisted. Meanwhile, Faliq read her ancient dwarven tome and was mentally transported to a celestial forge, where a dwarven god, **Hemmig**, guided her to contribute a divine sword to the book’s pages—its name and details unknown.

Over three days, the party constructed a sawmill and began repairing **The Codfather**. Ulric, Manon, and Sin infiltrated a guarded estate to steal the _Sword of General Persinious_; they triggered an alarm, summoned a greater demon, and escaped through the roof with the weapon. Meanwhile, **Dags** hired seamstresses to rebuild and decorate the ship, commissioning a deep “slaughter red” balloon and upgrading its structure. After two weeks of work and heavy spending, the ship was complete.

**Faliq** and **Minka** bought matching T-shirts and clothes while the final preparations finished. The newly refurbished ship was christened the **Bloodwind Marauder**, though the ceremonial bottle refused to break. It could now cruise at 22 knots on water. With the youngest **Dansk** son, **Timeteo**, joining as a deckhand, the group set sail from **GoodWeather Bay** toward their next adventure.
