## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/008 11-25-2025\|008 11-25-2025]]
> The party launched a chaotic airborne assault on the massive enemy airship Sturmwolke, destroying much of its crew and crippling both ships in a brutal midair battle. The Bloodwind Marauder was ultimately destroyed when its nuclear core detonated on ocean impact, though Manon heroically recovered the core mid-explosion. The party captured the Sturmwolke, took one survivor named Barry, and uncovered documents tying the ship to the Gorloin Technocracy. The session ended with Ulric’s owl egg finally hatching.

> The party staged a fake explosion using Mama Yasha’s magic to cover up their takeover of the soldiers, appointing Paulie as the new leader. When 15–20 college steam tanks attacked, the group fought back with aerial bombing, archery volleys, berserker fury, _gaseous escape_, and an **enlarged Balgura flipping tanks like toys**. As they began to win, a massive sky-warship—the **Sturmwulke**—descended from the clouds.

## AI Summary
The party launched a daring sky assault on the colossal airship **Sturmwolke** just before sunrise. **Dags** and **Ulric Moonshadow** rode flying carpets toward the enemy vessel while **Sin** forced the Bloodwind Marauder’s burners into overdrive to climb above the clouds. From below, the Sturmwolke swept the city ruins with searchlights as its massive propellers and sleek armored balloon cut through the dawn sky. Once in position above the enemy ship, the party dropped **Boogey the Balgura**, who was immediately riddled with bullets. Mortally wounded, he opened a book of pre-written explosive scrolls—triggering a massive blast that obliterated the top deck and took his own life.

Invisible, Dags, Ulric, and Sin infiltrated the ship, with Sin descending into its belly to find a massive arcane cannon. Meanwhile, **Manon** fired three heavy cannons into the Sturmwolke’s balloon clusters, collapsing sections of their lift. The enemy retaliated brutally, scoring a hit that instantly killed **Timeteo**—leaving only his severed hand clutching the wheel. The Sturmwolke then rotated to aim its gigantic aft cannon at the Marauder.

Below deck, Dags brawled with a mechanic until **Adira** descended, raging and finishing the man with a divine beam of light. Up above, **Faliq**, **Manon**, **Flynn**, **Minka**, and **Mama Yasha** kept a furious broadside of cannon fire going. Ulric repeatedly hopped between ships on his carpet, targeting the propeller assemblies. Flynn later boarded and tore through the surviving crew with his echo knight.

Below, Sin used **Wall of Fire** to cremate the cannon crew and free the arcane cannon. With Dags’ help, she disconnected it, flipped it onto its side, mounted it like a war steed, and fired directly into the steering column—killing the pilot and shredding the balloon’s frame. The recoil launched her off the ship and into the sky.

The Sturmwolke’s next volley catastrophically destroyed the Marauder’s balloon, sending it plummeting. Manon activated a hidden “oh-shit” overdrive button installed by Dags, crippling the engines but giving the ship one final burst of speed toward the ocean. The enemy’s last cannon shot severed the steering controls entirely. Realizing the ship was doomed, Mama Yasha cast Fly on Minka, Manon, and Faliq, and they evacuated—Faliq grabbing Timeteo’s hand to bury later.

The Marauder hit the ocean at 60 mph and disintegrated. Its nuclear reactor detonated on contact with the water, turning the ship into shrapnel. Heroically, Manon dove into the blast zone, used her Bag of Holding to suck the core inside, and saved it.

Aboard the crippled Sturmwolke, Adira cornered and butchered the remaining crew, sparing only **Barry** for interrogation—who recognized them instantly because of the fake moustaches matching the doodled moustaches Manon puts on wanted posters. Flynn and Adira purged the lower decks. Dags regained control of the helm.

Ulric scavenged documents pointing not to the College but to the mysterious **Gorloin Technocracy**, hinting at deeper political forces behind the attack. Finally, Ulric’s long-awaited egg hatched—revealing a newborn owl companion.

## Log
[[campaign/players/Dags\|Dags]] and [[campaign/players/Ulric Moonshadow\|Ulric Moonshadow]] take off on carpets towards the large ship. it has two propeller systems. very large cannon. The balloon is sleek and meant for speed. 
There is dozens of crew members on it. [[campaign/players/Sin\|Sin]] uses control fire to try and get the burners to max out. Lifting the ship as high as we can. We do not see burners on the ship.

as we ascend we see the ship from our ship. They are shining spotlights at the ground towards the scene of the city. It is just before sunrise, and we get above cloud cover. Sins instructs [[campaign/players/Adira\|Adira]] to steer the [[campaign/items/Bloodwind Marauder\|Bloodwind Marauder]] above the ship. We drop boogey our Balgura on them, to which he lands on the ship and immediately gets the wind knocked out of him.

Dags and Ulrich board the ship invisibly, as does sin. Sin also goes invisible and ventures down under the belly of the Sturmwolke looking for mechanical things and finds a giant arcane cannon.

Boogie (who was about to die from the barrage of bullets he immediately received from landing on the ship) opens a book full of pre-written explosive scrolls, causing a massive explosion on the ship, destroying himself and many enemies on the top of the ship. 
[[campaign/players/Manon\|Manon]], using some held actions, set off a barrage of 3 cannons deflating portions of the ballasted enemies ship balloons. The ship fired back, dealing major damage to the Bloodwind Marauder, instantly killing [[campaign/npcs/Timeteo\|Timeteo]], leaving only his hand still holding the steering wheel. The [[campaign/items/Sturmwolke\|Sturmwolke]]  then turned to point its giant rear cannon at our ship. 

Dags goes under the ship and gets into a fight with a mechanic. they exchange swings with pipes. sin notices there are men manning the giant arcane cannon, and cast a wall of flame to trap them by the cannon and kill them. Adira takes a flying carpet and comes down as well to the lower end of the ship, and starts to rage, casting a beam of light and killing the man that Dags was fighting. Meanwhile, Faliq, Manon, Minka, Flynn, and Mama Yasha are on the ship. Faliq,Manon, and Flynn continue to send volleys of cannon fire with Minka reloading cannons as they go. Ulrich begins to hop on and off the ship on his flying carpet, targeting the controlling propellers of the ship. Eventually Flynn takes a flying carpet onto the ship as well. He begins fileting the crew still on the top with his echo knight. Meanwhile, downstairs, Dags opens a door and absent mindedly shoots a bag of gun powder the cannoneers were using, severely damaging him and sending sin flying into a wall. Sin CONSIDERS getting Dags back by blowing him up with another bag of gunpowder but decides against it, and ultimately gets Dags to help her disconnect the giant canon that they determine to be magical and physical from Dags inspecting it. Sin then flips the cannon over, straddling it like a horse and fires it upwards to the balloon and steering area of the ship. It kills the man steering the ship, and severely damages the balloon, and it sends the canon and her flying off of the ship backwards towards the ground. 

The next volley from the enemy ship critically hits our ship, completely destroying our balloon now making it start falling from the sky. Manon immediately tries to steer the ship towards the ocean, finding an "oh shit" button on the steering column that Dags had the foresight to install. This sent the ship into overdrive, but damaged the ships engines in the process. As the Bloodwind Marauder is trying to escape the fight and make it to sea, with the last Hail-Mary cannon shot from the Stormwolke struck true, completely severing the controls from the Bloodwind marauder, leaving nothing but a mess of wires and pipes in front of Manon. The Bloodwind Marauder is still heading full steam ahead to the ocean, but has completely lost all controls. Mama Yasha is able to cast fly on Minka, Manon, and Faliq, allowing them a way to escape if the ship doesnt make it to the ocean (its slim odds whether they're going to make). The ship doesn't seem like its going to make it so Minka, Mama Yasha, Manon and Faliq abandon the ship and fly off., 

Back on the ship Adira had killed many many many men with her axe, and caused a few to piss themselves and try to leave. She boxed them into a corner and tried to convince them to help us take back over the ship. they tried to flee so she chopped them down as well. Dags made his way back to the steering area and began steering the ship after Sin had killed the pilot with the arcane cannon. Flynn proceeded to the lowest portion of the ship and brutally massacred everyone in his way. Adira then also goes down towards the lowest end on the opposite side of the ship to box the rest of the crew in. She ALSO brutally murdering everyone she sees (save one crew member for interrogation purposes)

Back on the Bloodwind Marauder Faliqm Mama Yasha, and Manon fly away abandoning ship, Faliq taking Timeteo's severed hand with her to have something to bury him. The Bloodwind marauder hits the water at 60mph. It smacks the water so hard that the ship essentially tears itself apart. The nuclear core reacts with the water, turning the ship into shrapnel in a very large explosion. Manon tries to dive into the water to save the reactor. She opens her bag of holding beneath it, sucking it into the bag and keeping it safe. 

Ulric investigates the ship trying to find information. He finds documents that don't mention the college, but instead reference the [[Gorloin Technocracy\|Gorloin Technocracy]]. We had one survivor we kept named [[Barry\|Barry]], and when the crew put moustaches on he immediately recognized them (because Manon always drew moustaches on all pictures, including our wanted) 

Finally, Ulrich's egg hatches, giving him a baby owl.
