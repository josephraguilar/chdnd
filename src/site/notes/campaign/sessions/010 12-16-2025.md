> The party returned to Darkwell, secured Joseph Smith as a prisoner, and uncovered crucial lore revealing a legendary dwarven weapon tied to Faliq’s past still exists somewhere in the world. After assessing the damaged _Sturmwulke_, they infiltrated the Gorllewyn Technocracy disguised as soldiers and learned the city had become heavily militarized under a new ruler. Forming an alliance with a small resistance group, the party split up to assassinate guards, sabotage generators, and incite chaos. When attempts to spark a riot failed, Sin summoned a demon, plunging the city into hysteria.

## AI Summary
Sin, Faliq, and Willie Big Ridges ignite a full-scale riot, culminating in a demon smashing government infrastructure—starting with a toll station for meter maids—while Dags, Adira, and Flynn sabotage generator stacks, causing premature explosions across the city. Simultaneously, Ulrich, Adira, and Katrina infiltrate the college, identifying a suspicious half-dwarven chancellor on a fifth-floor balcony as Manon disguises herself as a librarian to research Hell and steal occult texts. Ulrich bluffs his way into an office using misty step, while the rest of the party regroups and violently breaches the college gates—Flynn distracting guards with his echo, Sin sneaking invisibly to unlock doors, and Adira raging with wild magic that accidentally injures Sin.

Manon exploits the chaos inside the library, stealing infernal books and tricking the head librarian—Mr. Skittles, a scrotum-faced tabaxi—into unknowingly signing over his soul via one of Sin’s contracts. Sin infiltrates the chancellor’s chambers invisibly, stealing the prototype firearm “Pixie Popper,” while Faliq uncovers valuable religious texts, including a tome on Chromae, goddess of death, funerals, and last rites. As the demon approaches (27 minutes out), Manon and Ulrich disguise themselves as guards to access the dorms, Flynn cons guards into a shift change, and Sin searches for the chancellor’s secrets—only to spot him in the mirror, aiming a gun directly at her. The session closes with revolutionary ideals declared: clean energy, militarized protection, and the birth of a republic—with Willie Big Ridges crowned “Pelosi Prime.”

## Log
Sin and Faliq and [[Willie Big Ridges\|Willie Big Ridges]] start a riot and the demon starts smashing government buildings. Specifically, a toll station for meter maids. Dags, Adira, and Flynn successfully load their coal into the generator stacks and the generators start blowing up well before intended. Ulrich, adira, and katrina successfully infiltrate the college and skulk around, looking for the leader of the college. adira investigates and sees on a 5th floor balcony a rotund shorter gentlemen, half dwarven man. Manon then disguises herself as a librarian and enters the library to look for books on Hell for Sin. Ulrich misty steps into the library past guards as well and ends up in someone's office. He pretends he's supposed to be there and starts looking around 

The rest of the party after doing there shenanigans (blowing up generators and starting a riot) they met at the rendezvous point bar and decided to storm the college to try and aid ulrich manon and katrina, whos whereabouts and status were unknown. Flynn uses his echo knight to distract the guards on the other side of the wall, while sin went invisible to go unlock the door latch from the other side while they are distracted. Adira starts raging and throwing axes at the gate. Her wild magic made a flubber looking piece of goo spawn, and then explode at the end of her turn, damaging the guards on the other side of the gate as well as sin who was invisible. The party engages them trying to gai entryt. 

WHile that is hapening manon searches the library and finds the section on the occult, and swipes a bunch of hellish books into her cart that she is pushing around. She starts to observer the guards, looking for a weak point in security for her to gain entry into the inner workings of the college. Faliq steals a decorative button off of his garb.

The party beats the guards and takes one hostage. They force him to get the party access to the library. Manon takes one of Sins contracts and gets the head librarian to sign over his soul unintentionally. The head librarian is a scrotum looking tabaxian named mister skittles. 

sin flies up to the balcony and tries to sneak in where the chancellor is. She accidentally breaks a terracotta pot and alerts the chancellor who grabs a prototype gun. She flies in (still invisible) and hides in the corners of the room. She also steal a small gun off the wall called the "Pixie Popper". 

Faliq finds a few texts on religion, and does not find any book on the weapon she crafted. But she does find extensive collections on the dieties and documented interactions with gods. She takes the shiniest ones, a book about Chromae, the goddess of deaths funerals sadness & last rights. Lots of tarnished stirling silver and dark stones. Ulrich sent his ferret to find manon and keep an eye on her. Manon told ulrich through the ferret that they were going to disguise themselves as the guards and try to gain entry to the dorms (were the chancellor is). The demon is now 27 minutes away. 

Manon and Ulrich sneak past some guards guarding the bottom of the dorms where the chancellor is. Flynn convinces the guards they are swapping shifts with the guards. They then race up to the 5th floor where they saw the chancellor. As they are doing that sin tries to find a diary or journal of the chancellor. As she finds some letters in a drawer she saw the chancellor in the mirror of the boudoir aiming a gun at her direction

Clean energy, power be free, military is going to be to guard and protect the. 

We enact a republic of voted in officials to rule, with willie big bridges is Pelosi Prime.
