We began to fight captain silver, lady Hildreth, and the baron. Lady Hildreth turned out to be an extremely strong necromancer who disintegrated Elwyn, and killed Symphony. The group disguised themselves as the baron, lady Hildreth, and captain silver. They ordered the city to reassemble the ship as quickly as they can.

## Log

The team left GoodWeather Bay and headed for the Gooseberry Woods. The group decides to push through and not camp for the night. THe terrain began to become rougher with moist ground and damp overgrowth. 

[[campaign/npcs/Heironimus\|Heironimus]] said that he was well prepared but the group realizes that he's just an aspiring hunter, and has only done target practice. He hasnt actually killed anything. Ulric climbs a tree to look for something. 

The team knows that there is a large beast that tends to be out here that's like a large rabbit. Sin tries to bait a beast with a rabbit noise and Herinimous goes to look for something in the brush. He started making noises to bait animals and then we hear a loud crack from the gun. He killed a [[Dillgoat\|Dillgoat]] which is native to the area. 

We field dress the Dillgoat, heironimous pukes from the sight. 

Faliq dug a hole, and we hung out the carcass for bait over the whole. Adira placed traps around the area as the group hid and waited. Most of us hid in trees.

We hear a large beast appear. A large winged creature, both feathered and fur approaches, about the size of a bull. weird humanish face, leathery wings, serpentine tail. A MANTICORE!

Manon got a sneak attack and shot the beast. Ulric leaps out and stabs the beast. 

Flynn walks up and gives the the Manticore a 1-2 punch, and killed it with his literal bare hands. She did this while trying to impress Manon but instead aroused an owl, that hatched an egg that Ulric caught and kept with him. 

We beheaded the manticore and skinned it. We then decided to use the hole that was dug to make a bonfire and cook and eat the Dillgoat. we made dillogoat curry pie. Sin had her unseen servant mess with heironimous

We go back to the hunters lodge to sell the manticore but the manager tries to lowball us. Faliq buys drugs from [[campaign/npcs/Becky\|Becky]] and Sin tried to get Herinimous to write away his soul for free dinner but fails. Manon goes to rob the managers office, and gets 600 Gold. 

We got 400 gold plus dinner. We got dinner to go, and Faliq drugged heronimous.

Flynn takes us to [[Whoropoly\|Whoropoly]]. This is a very guilded over the top whore house. The front door-knockers are just a pair of "knockers". its got cherubs on paintings and chandelier. It's smells like aged liquers and cented candles. We are greeted quickly by an upper middleaged woman. 
Manon and Dags retire to the room while the rest go to drink and Gamble. Faliq goes and gets herself Sin and Adira "house specials". Faliq drugs Sins drink, to which she is especially susceptible and starts spilling secrets about her origin. Faliq eventually takes Sin to go to bed. 

Ulrich pays two whoers to gather information on two men who were having a secretive conversation. 

The following morning, one of the mans is an importer and is looking to opening a shop here. He was with a woman who did own a shop he was importing goods to. She gave us the address to it. 

The group decides to take on the quest for transporting the "normal" goods. We go to the shop listed for the quest,. The shop doesnt have a name posted, and we met [[campaign/npcs/James McGillicuddy\|James McGillicuddy]] . He said the delivery is only 100 gold. The trip is to take a couple pallets down to fishburg. We're delivering it to his cousing [[campaign/npcs/Shem McGillicuddy\|Shem McGillicuddy]]. 

The party took the goods and left to [[campaign/locations/Fighting Pit\|Fighting Pit]]and met a dwarfnamed [[campaign/npcs/Miles\|Miles]] who's brother is [[campaign/npcs/Shen\|Shen]] . THe minotaure we are after is called [[campaign/npcs/Minka\|Minka]]. Minka left and broke contract and breaking contract could extend it or charge them the remainign amounton contract. THe reamining amount on Minka's contract is  1500 Gold. 

Minka is "not" living in a small boat at the end of the harbor according to Maurice, their friend who is also under contract. A little sailing boat, with a cabin on-top, but not big enough for a crew. 

We went to the location Ulrich had listed from the whoers, it was called [[campaign/locations/La Salls\|La Salls]]. It was kind of like an antique or curious shop. We see the old man Ulrich paid at the bar. He said that the person we got the goods from had a fire at his warehouse. Its in the freight district. Dags showed him the Gladius. He said that it was the [[sword of general persinious\|sword of general persinious]]. Its worth 1000 gold. He then calls what was essentially a pallete jack golem and it brought back a bunch of flying rugs. 

Dags purchased two small carpets of flying and one medium. Sin paid 1000G for a soul in a mason jar. 

Faliq took one small carpet of flying
