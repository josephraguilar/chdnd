## AI Summary
The party traveled to meet **Isis Shatterscale** in an effort to resurrect **Sim**, but despite an expensive diamond-fueled ritual, **Sin** was brought back instead. Afterward, the group journeyed north to **Goodweather Bay**, where they arranged to repair their ship for 40,000 gold—half paid upfront. They met **Flynn**, a performer who had been kicked out of a bar, and later earned 7,000 gold at the smelter. Sin collected five souls for cookies and faked her own death at the smelter. In need of more money, Flynn introduced the party to **Harold**, a gnomish jeweler at _Didem’s Big and Small_, and they also met **Helga**, a tall half-giant woman. At **Dank and Sons Shipwrights**, they paid 17,000 gold and agreed to complete steam-powered milling stations to cover the rest of the repair costs. After ordering equipment at the smelter, they visited the **Prancing Pony**, a shady establishment, where they found various local job postings: hunting exotic animals for the **Hunter’s Lodge**, capturing a lost minotaur for the gladiator ring, delivering supplies, distributing army recruitment posters, and assisting with a wedding catering gig. The session ends with the group meeting **Heironimus** at the Hunter’s Lodge and preparing to head to **Gooseberry**.
