## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/007 11-18-2025\|007 11-18-2025]]
> The party staged a fake explosion using Mama Yasha’s magic to cover up their takeover of the soldiers, appointing Paulie as the new leader. When 15–20 college steam tanks attacked, the group fought back with aerial bombing, archery volleys, berserker fury, _gaseous escape_, and an **enlarged Balgura flipping tanks like toys**. As they began to win, a massive sky-warship—the **Sturmwulke**—descended from the clouds.

> The party returned the Shatterwood golems home, then traveled to Darkwell Keep and discovered the Conservatory had seized military control using advanced machinery the party indirectly funded. After gathering intel on the city’s tanks, rallying allies, and coordinating with Drusilla to cut the lights, they launched a nighttime assault using the Bloodwind Marauder. A massive explosion disabled the generator and triggered a battle in which the party destroyed the tanks and liberated the city. The victory came at the cost of many civilian casualties and severe damage to their ship.

## AI Summary
The party finished securing the city after defeating its occupying forces and convinced **Paulie** to step into leadership. Dags spoke with **Lt. Archibald Ashburn**, while uncertainty lingered about whether **Heironimus Jebadiah Maurice Von Ipswitch Lasertilla IV**, the college’s archmage, was still officially in command. The group rounded up the boilermakers to craft steam bombs, then enlisted **Mama Yasha**—wearing a Top Gun–style bomber jacket—to erase the college soldiers’ memories of the past 12 hours and stage a fake generator explosion. She projected an illusory reenactment of the blast, Sin played the role of a WWII nurse, Manon killed and mourned a soldier whose wipe failed, and Ashburn’s mind was badly damaged, leaving him affectionate and confused. With the soldiers convinced by the ruse, the party elevated Paulie as their new commander.

Preparing for the college’s retaliation, the party transformed three steam generators into aerial bombs and mounted them on flying carpets. Manon laid traps, positioned **Drusilla Asvidel’s** scouts, and mounted a warhorse to lead their improvised army. Afterward, the group shared a quiet lunch, discovering Ashburn’s love of pancakes.

Manon’s alarm spell triggered when **15–20 arcane diesel-punk steam tanks** approached. Sin infiltrated the enemy disguised as a wounded soldier, but was unexpectedly pulled into a tank for “safety.” When the battle began, the party’s prepared tanks missed many shots while the enemy landed theirs. Dags dropped a bomb on the fourth tank; Ulrich carpet-bombed soldiers with dynamite and arrows; Faliq’s bomb rocked the third tank, terrifying Sin. Sin convinced her tank-mate she was cursed by Ashburn, escaped via _gaseous form_, and fled. Manon’s archery killed critical drivers, sending tanks crashing, while Faliq shredded lines of soldiers with piercing-shot dives.

Two friendly roadside tanks exploded in the enemy volley. Dags fired a depleted-uranium shot that disabled the lead tank, then poured water into its pipes to steam-cook the crew. Ulrich killed another driver and boiled his tank as well, later detonating dynamite that annihilated an entire section of the front line. Faliq dropped into melee, smashing pipes and “golf-swinging” fleeing soldiers with her greatsword. Minka drunkenly berserked through infantry, impaling a man with her horn.

Sin summoned her Balgura, **Boogy**, and cast _enlarge_—turning him into King-Kong-scaled destruction. Giant Boogy rampaged across the battlefield, flipping tanks like toys and scattering soldiers.

Just as the party began to decisively win, a deafening horn sounded across the sky. A colossal mechanical vessel descended from the clouds, its nameplate reading **Sturmwulke**... oh shit...

## Log
The party succeeded in beating the forces in the city. The party convinces [[campaign/npcs/Paulie\|Paulie]] to 

dags talks to [[campaign/npcs/Lt. Archibald Ashburn\|Lt. Archibald Ashburn]]

[[heironimus jebadiah maurice von ipswitch Lasertilla IV\|Heironimus Jebadiah Maurice Von Ipswitch Lasertilla IV]]  was the archmage of the college, not sure  if he was left in charge or not

we gathered all of the boiler makers to make steam-bombed. 

we convinced [[campaign/npcs/Mama Yasha\|Mama Yasha]] (who was dressed in a dope af bomber jacket, think top gun) to take the memories of the last 12 hours from the college soldiers and stage the explosion of the generator 
- Mama Yasha used major illusion to play back the explosion in real time as we woke up the soldiers
- sin acted as a wwII-esque nurse/nurse joy to explain the "accident" they were in
- Manon killed one of the guys who's memory wipe went bad and then pretended to mourn his death when everyone woke up from the mind wipe
- lt. archibald Ashburn is now mentally disabled due to the mind wipe failing and was hugging everyone
- we elected Paulie as the leader of the soldiers now

we rounded up 3 of the steam generators to make bombs out of and ready them on the flying carpet to be used as bombs

manon sets up traps for foot soldiers.  she also puts out [[campaign/npcs/Drusilla Asvidel\|Drusilla Asvidel]] men to lookout for the college and mounted a large horse from the stables to lead the army. 

after arranging to prepare for battle, we all have lunch and hungout, it was uneventful but we learned that Lt. Aarchibald ashburn likes pancakes

the college forces show up, setting off Manon's alarm spell.

15-20 tanks. roll up

sin roleplays as a wounded soldier to convince the approaching forces that its an insurgency from ashburn archibald. the leading captain put sin in his tank saying "its safe in here" which sin did not want and took her off guard. 

The battle starts, the tanks we set up missed a ton of their shots, while the approaching forces landed all of theirs. [[campaign/players/Dags\|Dags]] dropped his bomb off, dealing major damage to the 4th tank (sin was in the first). Ulrich dropped some dynamite from a magic carpet, damaging some soldiers. He then shot another with his short bow from the carpet. Faliq dropped her bomb off of her carpet, dealing major damage to the 3rd tank (scaring sin even more, (ITS GETTING CLOSER)).  sin tells the person in the tank with he she was cursed by ashburn archibald, and then turned into a gaseous form and runs away. Manon struck the front driver and second driver of the tanks with arrows, sending the second tank careening off because the driver died. Faliq dived down multiple times, using her magic arrow piercing shot to take out scores of men down the tank line. 

two of our setup roadside tanks exploded in the next volley from the oncoming tanks

Dags shoots his depleted uranium bullet through the engine of the front tank, disabling the engine. He then poured his water into the pipes and caused steam to expand and fry all the people inside of it. 

ulrich kills the driver of the third tank, and then dumps water down its pipes, causing the people inside to boil and flee

manon kills many of the men on the front line with her and her line of archers sending volleys from behind the wall. 

the men of the college begin returning fire on our forces with their rifles.

dags casts shatter on a tank, completely disabling it

ulrich drops another stick of dynamite, causing a tank to fully explode and levels the front line of men in wake of it. 

Faliq drops down from her carpet to close combat and breaks the pipes on a tank, causing it to smoke out the men inside. She then played golf with her greatsword on the heads of the men coming out of the top hatch. 

Minka is drunkenly berzerking on men, impaling the skull of one of them with her horn. 

Sin summons her Balgura "Boogy" again, but this time she casted enlarge on him, making him more of a king kong, who then proceeded to flip some of the tanks like toys

as we are winning the fight, a bellowing horn breaks out as we see a giant mechanical structure descneding from the clouds

faliq reads its nameplate on the ship "[[campaign/items/Sturmwolke\|Sturmwolke]]"... we end the session there, with a cliffhanger of what is going to happen with the large behemoth of a ship descending from the clouds.
