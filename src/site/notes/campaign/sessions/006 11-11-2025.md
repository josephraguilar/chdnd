## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/006 11-11-2025\|006 11-11-2025]]
> The party returned the golems of Shatterwood Forest, uncovered Sin’s tragic past, and later traveled to Darkwell Keep—now overtaken by a university’s mechanized regime they had indirectly empowered. Teaming with Drusilla, Paulie, and the city’s underworld, they launched a daring pre-dawn assault, destroying the city’s generator and battling six armored tanks. Though victorious, their liberation of Darkwell came with devastating collateral damage and a crippled ship.

> The party convinced Minka to join them, uncovered snake venom bound for a thieves’ guild, and Sin hilariously called “tech support” for her soul. Faliq communed with a dwarven deity forging a divine sword, while the group rebuilt their ship, now the _Bloodwind Marauder_. After stealing the Sword of General Persinious and recruiting Timeteo, they set sail from GoodWeather Bay.

## AI Summary
The party traveled through **Shatterwood Forest**, returning the ancient golems to their altar as protectors of the nearby town. **Sin** discovered her people had been slaughtered by organized bandits seeking the golems, and that the party had unknowingly avenged them. Taking the summoning stones, they journeyed to **Seahaven Mill**, where industrious kobolds toiled for “tickets” to **Maintenance’s Fun Hut**, now a gaudy, carnival-like casino. After some bizarre antics and rewards from **Maintenance**, the group set sail for **Darkwell Keep**.

Upon arrival, they found the once-shadowy city ablaze with artificial lights and smoke-belching machinery. Seeking answers, they met **Drusilla Asvidel**, a dampire whose authority had been replaced by the university’s new “safety initiative,” spurred by the party’s own past misdeeds with forged IOUs and stolen tech. Realizing they had indirectly enabled a technocratic occupation, the group began planning rebellion. **Sin** and **Adira** seduced and tricked a college officer to learn the tanks’ weaknesses, while **Faliq** gained insight from **Paulie**, a sympathetic worker who joined their cause.

At dawn, **Drusilla** plunged the city into darkness for fifteen minutes, and **Mama Yasha** cloaked the **Bloodwind Marauder** to blend into the sky. **Sin** summoned a **Barlgura demon** to sabotage the power generator, and **Dags** finished the job with dynamite, leveling a block of the city. As six armored tanks rolled out to defend the keep, the party fought fiercely—**Faliq** and **Manon** destroying two tanks, **Paulie** wreaking havoc with her wrench, and the group ultimately crippling the enemy forces. Though they liberated **Darkwell Keep**, the cost was steep: widespread destruction, many lives lost, and the **Bloodwind Marauder** heavily damaged.

## Log
The party heads to the [[campaign/locations/Shatterwood Forest\|Shatterwood Forest]]. We take them back to their altar where they originally resided as arcane protectors of the town. 

Sin finds out that her people were were killed by organized bandits that were after the golems and that the party got revenge on the clan. 

we took the summoning stones with us and head to maintenances fun hut in seahaven mill. 

in the seahaven mill we see lots of kobolds working. the kobolds seam more eager than normal, almost like their itching for something. 

A bell rings and they all head to maintenances fun hut. The kobolds are being paid in maintenances fun hut tickets., the inn is now lit brightly and full of color. We walk into maintenances fun hut.  THeres now a second floor balcony with games. There is now kobolds going crazy for the games. The prizes are a bunch of trash toys. 

faliq buys a mystery potion for sim, who agrees to drink it but didnt specify when. 

Maintenance and Roloth appear and maintenance shows up in a suit. 

Maintenance takes us up to his very nice office and pays us our dues. 

The party then takes the ship to [[campaign/locations/Darkwell Keep\|Darkwell Keep]]  . we see lots of light that doesnt look like torches. sin goes invisible and approaches. There is heavy mechanical clanking and noise. 

Dags wants to seek the help of [[campaign/npcs/Drusilla Asvidel\|Drusilla Asvidel]] , a dampire who is important. .

we get in and see there is heavy machinery offputting lots of smoke. everything is now illuminated. The once dark city is full of electric lights now leaving very few shadows for the underworld network to move about it.  The access to Adira's underground friends' area was locked, but she picked it easily and escorted us in. We meet manons friends and she asks them whats happening. THey say teh conservatory is expanding eastward over "safety" concerns. 

Sin fixes [[campaign/npcs/Samson\|Samson]]'s shoes for his soul, and cheers with him the blank mystery potion faliq bought her. it cursed everyone around, including many of Manon's friends, though they didnt knowit.  Because of this we went to a cleric to get it removed.  the cleric removed 3 curses, and Sin got pissed at everyone for blaming her for the repercussions of their own prank. Sin agreed to remove 3 of the curses after a long rest so she could prepare the remove curse spell

the party goes to talk to drusilla. she reveals her guard was dissolved and the college is now running security. This is because the elders at the university are pushing for "safety" after many of the funding went unaccounted for and the sight of advanced technology. This essentially means that the party caused this problem due to forging college IOU's to build their flying ship that they flaunted around the city before leaving. 

The mayor of teh college's township was pivotal in the movement, and they are pushing to secure the safety of all of Cartref. The party decides to liberate Darkwell Keep and seeks out information on how to defeat the heavy tanks and machinery defendig it currently. 

Adira and Sin go to a local inn where college security and machinery workers are and flash the whole food hall. They then meet a higher ranking officer who invites them to his office. Sin uses suggestion to make the officer tell her all about the design flaws of the tanks. 

Dags tries to get close to inspect the machinery to look for more design flaws, but is not able to get very near. 

faliq meets [[campaign/npcs/Paulie\|Paulie]] and asks if she can be a shoveler. paulie shows her the machines and shows her the inside of the machine. Ulrich uses his familiar to follow the two and notes down what is said, as well as a few pointers on flirting, which he failed to do miserably with Drusilla earlier. 

The party lets Drusilla know that we are going to attack the college personnel before dawn and Drusilla agrees to cut the lights for 15 minutes to aid us. 

We seek the aid of Adira's underworld friends to fight for us. Faliq convinces Pauli to turn tides and aid us in battle

Drusilla cut the lights to the extremely well lit town, allowing the party to fly the [[campaign/items/Bloodwind Marauder\|Bloodwind Marauder]] over the city, with the aid of Mama Yasha disguising the bottom of the ship as the night sky through magic. Just before the lights came back on, Sin summoned a greater Demon, a Barlgura, to try and bend the pipes of the town's central generator that they were using to illuminate the once darkness-shrouded city. The Barlgura failed, so Dags flew over it on a magic carpet and dropped dynamite down its smoke stack. The following explosion leveled a city block and killed around 20 workers. Once this started, 6 tanks began rolling out to fight the party. Faliq struck one in front with a blow from a canon and disabled it. Manon did the same to one in the rear, trapping the tanks. Paulie ran around like a wild-woman, taking out many guards with a swift monkey wrench to their knees. 

The party ended the session having disabled the tanks, and defeating the guards liberating the city. but it came at the cost of heavy damage to the ship and many casualties on the ground.
