## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/006 11-11-2025\|006 11-11-2025]]
> The party returned the Shatterwood golems home, then traveled to Darkwell Keep and discovered the Conservatory had seized military control using advanced machinery the party indirectly funded. After gathering intel on the city’s tanks, rallying allies, and coordinating with Drusilla to cut the lights, they launched a nighttime assault using the Bloodwind Marauder. A massive explosion disabled the generator and triggered a battle in which the party destroyed the tanks and liberated the city. The victory came at the cost of many civilian casualties and severe damage to their ship.

> The party convinced Minka to join them, uncovered snake venom bound for a thieves’ guild, and Sin hilariously called “tech support” for her soul. Faliq communed with a dwarven deity forging a divine sword, while the group rebuilt their ship, now the _Bloodwind Marauder_. After stealing the Sword of General Persinious and recruiting Timeteo, they set sail from GoodWeather Bay.

## AI Summary
The party traveled to **Shatterwood Forest**, returning the arcane golem protectors to their original altar. Sin learned that **Adira’s people were massacred by organized bandits** seeking the golems—bandits the party later avenged. The group collected the summoning stones and continued on to **Maintenance’s Fun Hut** in Seahaven Mill, where they discovered the kobolds frenzied with excitement, earning tickets as payment to play gaudy carnival games with trash-tier prizes.

Faliq bought Sin a mystery potion, which Sin agreed to drink at an unspecified time. Maintenance and Roloth, arriving theatrically in suits, paid the party and sent them on their way. The crew then took the ship to **Darkwell Keep**, now glowing with new artificial lighting and loud industrial machinery. Sin scouted invisibly while the party approached, hoping to contact **Drusilla Asvidel**, an influential dampire.

Inside the city, the crew found Darkwell transformed: **smoke-belching machines**, **electrical lamps**, and **heavy guard presence** by the newly expanded **Conservatory**. The underworld passages Adira used to frequent were locked, though she easily picked the door and visited her contacts, who explained that the Conservatory was seizing territory under the guise of “public safety.”

Sin accidentally cursed several of Manon’s friends by drinking the mystery potion with Samson. A cleric dispelled a few curses, and Sin—angry at being blamed for drinking a potion someone else bought—agreed to remove additional curses after a rest. When speaking with Drusilla, the party learned their own forged IOUs and the public display of their flying ship triggered a political crackdown, prompting the college to assume military control. Darkwell Keep was effectively occupied.

Seeking weaknesses in the city’s new tech, Sin and Adira infiltrated a mess hall, charmed an officer using _Suggestion_, and extracted information about design flaws in the tanks. Dags attempted to inspect machinery but was denied access. Faliq befriended **Paulie**, who showed her the interior of a tank; Ulrich’s familiar spied on them and listened in, though Ulrich failed hilariously in his attempts to flirt with Drusilla earlier.

The party coordinated with Drusilla, who agreed to shut down the city’s powerful lighting system for 15 minutes before dawn. They rallied Adira’s underground allies and convinced Paulie to join them. With the lights cut, **the Bloodwind Marauder**—camouflaged from below by Mama Yasha’s illusion magic—flew over the city to begin the assault.

Sin summoned a **Barlgura** to sabotage the generator pipes, but it failed. Dags then dropped dynamite down the generator’s smokestack, causing a massive explosion that **leveled a city block and killed roughly 20 workers**. Six heavy tanks rolled out to retaliate, but Faliq and Manon disabled the front and back tanks, trapping the convoy. Paulie rampaged through the chaos, crippling guards with a monkey wrench.

By the end of the session, the party had successfully **disabled the tanks, defeated the guards, and liberated Darkwell Keep**, but at a cost: **significant casualties** on the ground and **heavy damage to the Bloodwind Marauder**.

## Log
The party heads to the [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipalegos/Shatterwood Forest\|Shatterwood Forest]]. We take them back to their altar where they originally resided as arcane protectors of the town. 

Sin finds out that Adira's people were were killed by organized bandits that were after the golems and that the party got revenge on the clan. 

The party took the summoning stones with us and head to maintenances fun hut in seahaven mill. 

in the seahaven mill we see lots of kobolds working. the kobolds seam more eager than normal, almost like their itching for something. 

A bell rings and they all head to maintenances fun hut. The kobolds are being paid in maintenances fun hut tickets., the inn is now lit brightly and full of color. We walk into maintenances fun hut.  THeres now a second floor balcony with games. There is now kobolds going crazy for the games. The prizes are a bunch of trash toys. 

faliq buys a mystery potion for sim, who agrees to drink it but didnt specify when. 

Maintenance and Roloth appear and maintenance shows up in a suit. 

Maintenance takes us up to his very nice office and pays us our dues. 

The party then takes the ship to [[campaign/locations/3_cities & islands/Darkwell Keep\|Darkwell Keep]]  . we see lots of light that doesnt look like torches. sin goes invisible and approaches. There is heavy mechanical clanking and noise. 

Dags wants to seek the help of [[campaign/npcs/Drusilla Asvidel\|Drusilla Asvidel]] , a dampire who is important. .

we get in and see there is heavy machinery offputting lots of smoke. everything is now illuminated. The once dark city is full of electric lights now leaving very few shadows for the underworld network to move about it.  The access to Adira's underground friends' area was locked, but she picked it easily and escorted us in. We meet manons friends and she asks them whats happening. THey say teh conservatory is expanding eastward over "safety" concerns. 

Sin fixes [[campaign/npcs/Samson\|Samson]]'s shoes for his soul, and cheers with him the blank mystery potion faliq bought her. it cursed everyone around, including many of Manon's friends, though they didnt knowit.  Because of this we went to a cleric to get it removed.  the cleric removed 3 curses, and Sin got pissed at everyone for blaming her for the repercussions of their own prank. Sin agreed to remove 3 of the curses after a long rest so she could prepare the remove curse spell

the party goes to talk to drusilla. she reveals her guard was dissolved and the college is now running security. This is because the elders at the university are pushing for "safety" after many of the funding went unaccounted for and the sight of advanced technology. This essentially means that the party caused this problem due to forging college IOU's to build their flying ship that they flaunted around the city before leaving. 

The mayor of teh college's township was pivotal in the movement, and they are pushing to secure the safety of all of Cartref. The party decides to liberate Darkwell Keep and seeks out information on how to defeat the heavy tanks and machinery defendig it currently. 

Adira and Sin go to a local inn where college security and machinery workers are and flash the whole food hall. They then meet a higher ranking officer who invites them to his office. Sin uses suggestion to make the officer tell her all about the design flaws of the tanks. 

Dags tries to get close to inspect the machinery to look for more design flaws, but is not able to get very near. 

faliq meets [[campaign/npcs/Paulie\|Paulie]] and asks if she can be a shoveler. paulie shows her the machines and shows her the inside of the machine. Ulrich uses his familiar to follow the two and notes down what is said, as well as a few pointers on flirting, which he failed to do miserably with Drusilla earlier. 

The party lets Drusilla know that we are going to attack the college personnel before dawn and Drusilla agrees to cut the lights for 15 minutes to aid us. 

We seek the aid of Adira's underworld friends to fight for us. Faliq convinces Pauli to turn tides and aid us in battle

Drusilla cut the lights to the extremely well lit town, allowing the party to fly the [[campaign/items/Bloodwind Marauder\|Bloodwind Marauder]] over the city, with the aid of Mama Yasha disguising the bottom of the ship as the night sky through magic. Just before the lights came back on, Sin summoned a greater Demon, a Barlgura, to try and bend the pipes of the town's central generator that they were using to illuminate the once darkness-shrouded city. The Barlgura failed, so Dags flew over it on a magic carpet and dropped dynamite down its smoke stack. The following explosion leveled a city block and killed around 20 workers. Once this started, 6 tanks began rolling out to fight the party. Faliq struck one in front with a blow from a canon and disabled it. Manon did the same to one in the rear, trapping the tanks. Paulie ran around like a wild-woman, taking out many guards with a swift monkey wrench to their knees. 

The party ended the session having disabled the tanks, and defeating the guards liberating the city. but it came at the cost of heavy damage to the ship and many casualties on the ground.
