## AI Summary
The battle against **Lady Hilreth**, the Baron, and Captain Silver erupts in the grand halls of a decaying manor. After swiftly subduing the Baron, the party turns their focus to Lady Hilreth, who reveals herself as a master necromancer. With devastating precision, she disintegrates **Elowyn** into dust and slays **Sim** with _Finger of Death_, leaving her lifeless while clutching Elowyn’s ashes. As **Adira** charges the staircase and **Faliq** fires magical arrows, the room fills with a psychic black mist that nearly wipes out the entire party. In a final desperate act, **Ulric** summons twin psychic daggers and delivers the killing blow, ending the battle but leaving two of their companions dead. In the aftermath, the surviving heroes disguise themselves as their fallen enemies—Lady Hilreth, the Baron, and Captain Silver—to command the city to rebuild their ship and seize control of the situation.
