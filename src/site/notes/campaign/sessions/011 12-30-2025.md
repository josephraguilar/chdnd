> The party sparks a city-wide riot, sabotages power infrastructure, and infiltrates a college while a demon approaches, using disguises, deception, and raw violence to gain control. Manon steals infernal knowledge and accidentally claims a soul, Sin infiltrates the chancellor’s chambers and steals a prototype weapon, and Faliq uncovers powerful religious texts. As revolution brews and clean energy ideals rise, a new republic is declared—with Willie Big Ridges as its unlikely leader.

## AI Summary
In the aftermath of the coup, the party completed repairs on a prototype ship with help from the people of Gorllewyn, creating a new hybrid flying–sailing vessel called Iron Maw. During this downtime, Sin spent six months researching how to return to Hell and ultimately negotiated with infernal powers—culminating in Glasya releasing Sim’s soul, allowing Sim to return to her body, though at the moral cost of many condemned souls.

With Sim restored, the party set sail west toward Ollmhor, docking in the vibrant, Moroccan-inspired city of Shan'dar. There, the group explored bazaars, made questionable financial decisions, acquired powerful magical weapons—including the sentient blade Snickersnack—and stirred up plenty of interpersonal drama involving contracts, money, and bruised egos.

The night ended messily at Bakkalli's, with music, drinking, sabotage, and a fistfight. The following day, the party agreed to escort a merchant toward Lethran, crossing dangerous desert terrain—only to awaken to an imminent threat as a swarm of Ankheg emerged from beneath the sands.

## Log
In the wake of the coup, the party was able to finalize/repair one of the smaller protoype ship. Sin gave faliq the [[Pixie Popper\|Pixie Popper]], Faliq chilled out and waited for the ship to be repaired, Sin rummaged through the library for six months looking for any information on going back to hell. The party instilled clean energy and got the [[campaign/locations/3_cities & islands/Gorllewyn\|Gorllewyn]] people to assist them with repairing/making the new ship, The [[campaign/items/Iron Maw\|Iron Maw]]. Manon went home to help with the repair of her city [[campaign/locations/3_cities & islands/Darkwell Keep\|Darkwell Keep]]. Faliq went with Adira and Minka went to go pick up Greg, Ferdinand, and the Golems. 

Sin, in searching the library, finds books on the hell as a theological discussion. There is some practical books on "how to go to hell". She thinks she has some ways to go back, or if she'd go back as a fairy child, being sent to hell. She pulled out her hells IT ticket, its on number 7. 
As we are planning to travel to [[Nordenheim\|Nordenheim]] , the ticket timer counts off and seeming smokey hologram of Alochar with sims soul in a birdcage appears. He gives her 5 questions with which she asks about going back, but he doesnt know how. He eventually gets Glasya to join the evil zoom meeting, at which she says that sim is in trouble but her numbers were very good recently. Sin claimed all of the credit for those souls, not giving any to Manon or the group, who laughed openly as she did. Glasya says that Sim can come back because she's been performing so well, but will be on probation if she does. Sin agrees, and Glasya presents the soul of Sim in a blue sphere on the table. Sin puts it in a jumbers fun hut shot glass, and just before taking it she shoots a fireball at Dags, getting one last bit of revenge for when he almost blew her up. 

Sim CAME BACK TO HER BODY! claiming that she was stuck in hell mentally for two years, and ate nothing but pickle hot Cheetos the whole time as she was stuck in a locker most of the time. Sim is a bit morally torn when she finds out how many souls the party got consigned in order to get her back. 

The party takes off headed westward towards [[campaign/locations/1_continents/Ollmhor\|Ollmhor]] in the new flying ship. The party decides to land the ship in the water as it was adjusted to sail as well now. We docked in the city of [[campaign/locations/Shan'dar\|Shan'dar]]

Minka says the food is bad (they put spices in it she doesnt like) and says that its a party town. Lots of stuff to do. Theres a  multitude of races, many people are more suntanned. Men have their hair in long braids with gem. The structures are sandstone with lots of brightly colored accents, think morocco. The party is approached by a large man with a large beady bearded man. He gives us lots of information and hands us lots of exotic spiced fruits. 

Flynn buys a middle-eastern looking all black outfit. The party goes to the bazaar. Sim overpays for a decorative dagger because shes awful with money and worse at haggling. 

Faliq meets a dragonborne armorer/weapons maker. He shows her a steel greatsword of good quality and an obsidian greatsword. Dags detects a stronger magic from the back, and goes to peruse the wares of the weapons. He uses identify item and identifies a greenish blade that seems almost semi-organic names [[Snickersnack\|Snickersnack]]. The black blade is a moon touched greatsword. 

Faliq wants to buy Snickersnack, but its 8000 gold. She brings out Sim's old Tiara to trade, at which Sim didn't know that Faliq had it, so she bought the sword outright and traded faliq the sword for the tiara. As we walked the sword started talking, and we learned that it is a sentient sword. It doesnt think that it is a person trapped in a sword, but that it was made this way and always was a sword. 

The party looks for a bar and finds one named [[Bakkalli's\|Bakkalli's]]. Its a kind of hookah bar with an impressive bar.  We all got drinks and talk to our female bar maid. Flynn pulls out his lute and performs on the stage, doing very well and receiving tips from the crowd. We ask the maid about work we can do, she gives us the names of a few businesses that might need something shipped to the volcanic range near the area. 

Faliq and Minka argued about her contract incessantly, and eventually. Dags got tired of it and felt bad and gave Minka enough money to pay off her contract, which she does. Minka then to celebrate, gets a cute dress on and starts drinking like crazy because Dags is paying for drinks tonight. Faliq spikes Dag's drink without him noticing, and he gets REALLY sad. 

Dags and Flynn got into a fist fight because Dags was sad/mad/drugged that Flynn got Manon a ring that she was wearing. 

The party awakens the following morning and meets with a merchant who is traveling to [[Lethran\|Lethran]] . He invites us to travel with him and says he'll pay us for helping. 

Dags instructs [[campaign/npcs/Mama Yasha\|Mama Yasha]] to take the ship to meet us in Lethran. We pass through high windswept dunes. Minka and Sim dig out holes, and Dags shatters the ground excavating it out for cover. Minka tells sim a scary story about jack the snipper, who cuts peoples fingers off if they suck on them too much. 

In the morning the party awakes to a group of about a dozen [[Ankheg\|Ankheg]] that are approaching us.
