> The party launched a chaotic airborne assault on the massive enemy airship Sturmwolke, destroying much of its crew and crippling both ships in a brutal midair battle. The Bloodwind Marauder was ultimately destroyed when its nuclear core detonated on ocean impact, though Manon heroically recovered the core mid-explosion. The party captured the Sturmwolke, took one survivor named Barry, and uncovered documents tying the ship to the Gorloin Technocracy. The session ended with Ulric’s owl egg finally hatching.

## AI Summary
The party interrogated the dim-witted Joseph Smith and ultimately decided to bring him back to Darkwell as a prisoner. They were greeted by Paulie, who is still infatuated with Faliq. An attempt to convince Paulie to watch Joseph via an awkward proposed “thruple” failed, but she agreed to guard him as a prisoner instead. Paulie was placed in charge of Darkwell’s military operations, during which Sin secretly tricked her into signing away her soul. The party then met with Drusilla, who oversees Darkwell’s civil matters alongside Manon’s cousin Steve. Drusilla invited them to rest and granted access to her private library.

In the library, Flynn and Dags discovered texts on dangerous concoctions and explosives, while Manon and Faliq uncovered a dwarven historical account revealing that Faliq’s experience had happened before—when it did, the resulting weapon was left behind in the world and still exists somewhere. This revelation set the party on a new quest to locate the lost sword. Sin researched how fiends, devils, and demons adapt to the mortal realm but found nothing regarding severing soul bonds. Meanwhile, Flynn and Dags assessed the damage to the captured airship _Sturmwulke_ and documented needed repairs. The group decided to take Paulina aboard the damaged ship and return to the Gorllewyn Technocracy with the goal of dismantling the regime from within.

Along the way, Manon crafted poisons, Sin created soul-contract pamphlets, and the party infiltrated the Technocracy by posing as returning soldiers. After successfully passing inspection, they made their way to the Broken Drum tavern. There, the bartender—initially suspicious—recognized Dags thanks to Sin’s improvised mustache gag and shared intel about the city’s transformation into a bureaucratic, militarized state under the new headmaster/chancellor. The party hired the bartender to locate resistance members, who turned out to be a small, disorganized trio: Willie Big Ridges, Katrina Zahaar, and Sheila Beachwood.

The party split up to destabilize the city. Manon and Katrina assassinated guards near the college district using magically conjured fog. Dags and Flynn worked with Sheila to rig the city’s generators using explosive-filled coal cubes. Sin and Faliq attempted to incite a riot with Willie Big Ridges; when Sin’s propaganda failed to rally the crowd, she escalated the situation by summoning a demon to ignite mass hysteria.

## Log
The party interrogates joseph smith, who isnt very smart. Eventually they agree to take him back to Darkwell to find out what to do. The party is greeted by Paulie, still in love with Faliq. We tried to get Paulie watch over john smith, our pisoner, by being in a "thruple" with paulie, faliq and joseph smit, but paulie isnt into it. So instead we convince paulie to just watch joseph smith as a prisoner. We then leave Paulie in charge of all of the militaristic aspects of darkwell, in which Sin tricks her into signing away her soul for doing so. We then go to talk with Drusilla, who we left in charge of the civil aspects of darkwell along with Manon's cousin Steve. Drusilla then invites us to rest and look through her private library. Flynn and Dags find books on dangerous concoctions and explosives. Manon and Faliq find a book on the dwarven gods and their happening. In this book it is revealed that what Faliq had experienced has happened before in history, and when i did, the weapon crafted is actually left in the real world somewhere. So The sword is somewhere in the world, and now we want to find it. Sin finds a book on how fiends, devils and demons have acclimated to liing in the mortal realm, but not anything on breaking soul ties or bonds. 

Flynn and Dags go and try to work on the airship we took over, the sturmvulke. They take notes on what was damaged and what needs repaired. We decide to take paulina with us on the damaged sturmvulke back to the college city to try and kill the technocracy from within. 

Distilled snake venom is 3D6, half if saved CON 11.

Manon makes basic poison that adds 2d8 to melee weapons if failed CON 16 save.

Sin makes a bunch of pamphlets that say "I ___ give away rights to my immortal soul to Sin, in exchange for ___ "

We fly into the [[Gorllewyn Technocracy\|Gorllewyn Technocracy]], pretending to be returning officers from the fight. Faliq pretends to be injured and minka is carrying her. Dags starts shouting orders abot repairing the ship, sin is invisible and manon and flynn just give a good performance of being soldiers that are convincing enough for us to leave unquestioned. Sin flies up and sees a fire escape that is locked, and also a main throoughfare. She flies down to tell everyone and we decide to leave throgh the main throroughfare, with manon crafting us some fake id's. The party heads to an old dive bar that they had previoiusly done a circus show outisde of called the [[Broken Drum\|Broken Drum]]. We try to get intel but the bartender doesnt comply at first because he thinks were from the technocracy. Sin then holds a moustache up to Dags' face which causes the bartender to recognize him from before. THe bartender sends everyone home and starts telling us about what happened with the city since we were here last. He said that the headmaster/chancellor took over the town since the party stole all the money and ship and after the old big bad guy died. Now there is a shit ton of beaurocracy and paperwork and the town is more militaristic. 

we pay the bartender to go bring us people who he knows who might be a part of a "resistance" group. He brings back in a very large man, and a very small catfolk. 

The large mans name is [[Willie Big Ridges\|Willie Big Ridges]] , [[Katrina Zahaar\|Katrina Zahaar]] [[Sheila Beachwood\|Sheila Beachwood]] 
katrina is the cat folk. Willie talks to us about their "resistance" but its just the 3 of them with no plan. The party decides to each do something to overthrow the governmnet. Manon and Katrina go and assissinate some guards who are blocking the way to the main college area where the headmaster/chancellor is. They use a dense fog manon created to kill them all almost instantaneously under cover.  Dags and Flynn go with Shiela Beachwood to use her hollowed out coal cubes and insert explosives into them to take out the 4 generators in the city. They put 3-4 rigged explosives into the coal piles in preparation to create chaos. 

Sin and Faliq went with [[Willie Big Ridges\|Willie Big Ridges]] to try and start a riot. Sin kind of failed with enticing the masses with her story about how the government was expirementing on people and children in worship of the devil. As a last ditch effort  she ended up summoning a demon to cause mass hysteria.

The chancellors name is [[Maximillion Heimrich Bashard\|Maximillion Heimrich Bashard]]
