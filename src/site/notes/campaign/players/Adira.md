## WildMagic Table
| d8 | Effect |
|----|---------|
| 1 | **Shadowy tendrils** lash around you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. You also gain 1d12 temporary hit points. |
| 2 | You **teleport up to 30 feet** to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. |
| 3 | An **intangible spirit** (flumph or pixie, your choice) appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, the spirit explodes, and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again each turn as a bonus action. |
| 4 | **Magic infuses one weapon** of your choice that you are holding. Until your rage ends, the weaponâ€™s damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties (range 20/60). If the weapon leaves your hand, it reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn. |
| 5 | Whenever a creature **hits you with an attack** before your rage ends, that creature takes 1d6 force damage as magic lashes out in retribution. |
| 6 | You are surrounded by **multicolored, protective lights**. You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus. |
| 7 | **Flowers and vines** temporarily grow around you. Until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies. |
| 8 | A **bolt of light** shoots from your chest. Another creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again each turn as a bonus action. |
